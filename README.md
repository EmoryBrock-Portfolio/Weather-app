# Weather App

Background

This is a weather application that uses the user submitted City Name and displays the current weather conditions for the city [temperature, weather description, wind speed and humidity].

The weather data is provided by OpenWeather's Current Weather Data API. [https://openweathermap.org/]

A live version of this app is posted at https://ebdevweatherapp.netlify.app/

Future Features

Here are a list of features that I would like to incorporate into this app.

1) Wind direction [both text and graphical]
2) Ability for user to determine how Temperature and Wind Speed info is displayed Metric (current default) or Imperial.
3) A graphical locator of the city on a map
4) Add error handling
